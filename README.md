archipelago
===========

(Only a few ideas for now)

This project helps sailors find a good place or harbour while sailing in the Stockholm Archipelago. The Stockholm archipelago is rather large (20 to 30 000 islands, depending how you count) and there are numerous places where one can anchor his boat for the night, bays or harbours. Example: https://goo.gl/maps/oQjo6

The very simple project lists (some of) the islands and provides information to get there:
* The distance (km) and direction
* The relative direction fo the wind
* The force of the wind in the next 2 hours

There is a list of islands with a small amount of data (distance, relative wind). Clicking on one gives a more detailed view of the island.

One can open a map to get a full featured map of the island and come back to the app with the back button (whatever map app).

Needs some thinking
